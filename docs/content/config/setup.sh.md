[`setup.sh`][github-file-setupsh] is an administration script that helps with the most common tasks, including initial configuration. It is intented to be used from the host machine, _not_ from within your running container.

The latest version of the script is included in the `docker-mailserver` repository. You may retrieve it at any time by running this command in your console:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/master/setup.sh
chmod a+x ./setup.sh
```

!!! info

    Make sure to get the `setup.sh` that comes with the release you're using. Look up the release and the git commit on which this release is based upon by selecting the appropriate tag on GitHub. This can done with the "Switch branches/tags" button on GitHub, choosing the right tag. This is done in order to rule out possible inconsistencies between versions.
