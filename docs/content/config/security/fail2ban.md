Fail2Ban is installed automatically and bans IP addresses for 3 hours after 3 failed attempts in 10 minutes by default. If you want to change this, you can easily edit [`config/fail2ban-jail.cf`][github-file-f2bjail].

You can do the same with the values from `fail2ban.conf`, e.g `dbpurgeage`. In that case you need to edit [`config/fail2ban-fail2ban.cf`][github-file-f2bconfig].

__Important__: The mail container must be launched with the `NET_ADMIN` capability in order to be able to install the iptable rules that actually ban IP addresses. Thus either include `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` in the docker run commandline or the equivalent `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
cap_add:
  - NET_ADMIN
```

If you don't you will see errors the form of:

```log
iptables -w -X f2b-postfix -- stderr: "getsockopt failed strangely: Operation not permitted\niptables v1.4.21: can't initialize iptabl
es table `filter': Permission denied (you must be root)\nPerhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.\niptables v1.4.21: can'
t initialize iptables table `filter': Permission denied (you must be root)\nPerhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.\n"

```

You can also manage and list the banned IPs with the [`setup.sh`][docs-setupsh] script.
