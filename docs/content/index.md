# Welcome to the Extended Documentation for `docker-mailserver`!

Please first have a look at the [`README.md`][github-file-readme] to setup and configure this server.

This wiki provides you with advanced configuration, detailed examples, and hints.

## Getting Started

1. The script [`setup.sh`][github-file-setupsh] is supplied with this project. It supports you in **configuring and administrating** your server. Information on how to get it and how to use it is available [on a dedicated page][docs-setupsh].
2. Be aware that advanced tasks may still require tweaking environment variables, reading through documentation and sometimes inspecting your running container for debugging purposes. After all, a mail server is a complex arrangement of various programs.
3. A list of all configuration options is provided in [`ENVIRONMENT.md`][github-file-env]. The [`README.md`][github-file-readme] is a good starting point to understand what this image is capable of.
4. A list of all optional and automatically created configuration files and directories is available [on the dedicated page][docs-optionalconfig].
